# Project Overview
## Background
Nowadays, as Internet getting into every corner of people's daily life, Internet
safety is becoming more and more important. This project focuses on web applications
safety. In this field, traditional security testers have to manually test each web
application and it contains many dirty and tedious work. Besides, for those web
application developers who want to do security test themselves before the first
release, the tools for security testing are difficult to master, which will cost
their precious developing time. Therefore, a smart tool for web application
penetration testing which can do test automatically would help these people grandly.


### Client
- Key client: The Centre For Internet Safety(CIS). Here is the brief [overview](http://www.canberra.edu.au/cis/aboutcis/) for CIS.

- Potential client: penetration testers and web application developers.

### Vision
Making use of knowledge of AI/machine learning to build a penetration testing tool
that can think like a human in order to perform automated penetration testing.

## Project
### Project name
- Smart Web Application Penetration Testing Tool

### Project supervisor
- Nigel Phair

### Objective
1. Investigate the idea of security penetration testing of web applications and learn the methodology and open source tools of penetration testing.
2. Combining the concepts of AI/machine learning with current open source penetration testing tools, design, build and test a simple, yet powerful, software tool which conducts security penetration testing automatically.

### Requirement for the prototype
The prototype designed will allow for automated penetration-testing, with the (open source) software being pointed a website, where it can register a legitimate account and scan for weaknesses in the profile-editing pages (among other things).

### Resources
- Kali Linux: a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing.
- OWASP ZAP: an open-source web application security scanner.
- Arachni: a feature-full, modular, high-performance Ruby framework aimed towards helping penetration testers and administrators evaluate the security of modern web applications.
- Python: a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.

### Constrains
- Lake of the knowledge for penetration testing.
- No example to reference.
